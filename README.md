# word_counter
This is a word counter in python, it counts how many words there are in a txt file. 
NOTE: It must be a txt file, the program does not accept other formats.

Operation:

When running the code "projeto_contador.py" in your code editor, the program will open a pop-up asking the user to select a folder on the computer.
After that, the path will be changed to the path of the selected folder, and the user must enter the name of a .txt file that exists within that path, don't worry, the value entered undergoes validation, first it is checked if the file exists in the path, then it is checked whether the file is a .txt file, if not, the program will send an error message, asking the user to try again.
When validating the file, the program asks the user if he wants to see the total number of words in that file, or if he wants to see the number of times a specific word appears in the text.
NOTE. The functionality to see how many times a word appears in the text is still under development, so the user should only type words without accents, as the program cannot work with accented words.
